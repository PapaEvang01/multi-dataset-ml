Dataset Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)

Description:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains 569 biopsy 
samples described by 30 numerical features representing geometric and 
textural properties of cell nuclei. These measurements are derived from 
digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies and include characteristics
such as radius, perimeter, smoothness, concavity, and symmetry.

Classification Task:
Binary classification of tumors into malignant (0) and benign (1).

Class Distribution:

Malignant: ~37%
Benign: ~63%

Notes:

The dataset presents a moderate class imbalance, making accuracy alone 
insufficient for reliable evaluation. Clinically critical errors, particularly 
false negatives (malignant cases predicted as benign), must be carefully analyzed.
Due to its clean structure, absence of missing values, and medically meaningful features, 
this dataset is well suited for benchmarking classical machine learning models in a 
healthcare-oriented context.
