Dataset Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)

Description:
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset consists of 569 breast biopsy
samples, each described by 30 numerical features capturing geometric and
textural properties of cell nuclei. These features are extracted from digitized
images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) biopsies and quantify characteristics such
as radius, perimeter, smoothness, concavity, and symmetry.

Classification Task:
Binary classification of breast tumors into:
- Malignant (0)
- Benign (1)

Class Distribution:
- Malignant: approximately 37%
- Benign: approximately 63%

Notes:
The dataset exhibits moderate class imbalance, making accuracy alone an
insufficient evaluation metric. Clinically critical errors—particularly false
negatives, where malignant cases are misclassified as benign—must be carefully
analyzed.

Due to its clean structure, absence of missing values, and clinically meaningful
features, this dataset is well suited for benchmarking classical machine
learning models and for developing safety-aware evaluation pipelines in
healthcare-oriented machine learning research.
