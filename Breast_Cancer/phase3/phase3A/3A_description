PHASE 3 — ERROR ANALYSIS & MODEL TRUST (Medical ML Focus)
=========================================================

Phase 3 shifts the focus from model performance to model trust.
Instead of asking “How accurate is the model?”, this phase asks
“Where does the model fail, how dangerous are those failures, and
can its decisions be justified in a medical setting?”

This phase builds directly on Phase 2 and reuses the same models,
training setup, and threshold-tuning logic to ensure full
reproducibility. No model behavior is changed — only analyzed.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 3A — Error Analysis (What fails, and where)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 3A investigates model errors at the sample level, with special
attention to clinically critical cases.

The analysis focuses on three categories:

1) False Negatives (FN)
   Malignant tumors incorrectly predicted as benign.
   These are the most dangerous errors in a medical screening context.

2) False Positives (FP)
   Benign tumors predicted as malignant.
   While less critical than FN, these increase unnecessary follow-up
   and patient anxiety.

3) Borderline cases
   Samples with predicted malignancy probability very close to the
   tuned decision threshold. These represent ambiguous cases where
   small changes in the decision rule can flip the outcome.

Rather than relying only on aggregate metrics, Phase 3A extracts and
stores the exact samples involved in each error category. This allows
direct inspection of difficult cases and realistic evaluation of
model behavior.

To improve interpretability, the phase also:
- Highlights the most confident false positives
- Highlights the most ambiguous borderline cases
- Visualizes probability distributions relative to the tuned threshold
- Compares false negatives and false positives before and after
  threshold tuning

All outputs are saved per model under:
results_phase3/error_analysis/<MODEL_NAME>/

Why Phase 3 matters
----------------------------------------------------------------

In medical machine learning, high accuracy alone is not sufficient.
Understanding *how*, *where*, and *why* models fail is essential for
safe deployment and clinical decision support.

Phase 3A provides the foundation for Phase 3B, where individual model
decisions will be explained in terms of feature contributions and
decision logic.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Next: Phase 3B — Model Explainability
----------------------------------------------------------------

Phase 3B will focus on explaining model decisions for the hardest and
most clinically relevant cases identified in Phase 3A. This includes
feature importance analysis and local explanations for false
negatives, false positives, and borderline samples.
