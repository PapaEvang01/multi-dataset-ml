Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 1: Baseline Models (Tabular Data)

Phase Overview
--------------
Phase 1 represents the first step of a structured, real-world machine learning
pipeline built on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The objective
of this phase is to establish strong and interpretable baseline models while
validating data quality, preprocessing decisions, and evaluation methodology
before progressing to more complex approaches.

Problem Description
-------------------
Given numerical features extracted from breast tumor biopsies—such as radius,
texture, smoothness, and concavity—the task is to classify each sample as:

- Malignant (0)
- Benign (1)

Dataset
-------
- Source: sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer
- Total samples: 569
- Total features: 30 numerical features
- Target encoding:
    0 → malignant
    1 → benign

Phase 1 Workflow
----------------
This phase follows a disciplined machine learning workflow with emphasis on
interpretability, generalization, and clinically meaningful evaluation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-------------------------------
The dataset is inspected to understand its structure, feature distributions,
and class balance. Visualizations such as class distribution plots and feature
histograms are generated to identify scale differences, skewness, and potential
outliers. This analysis is performed prior to model training and informs
subsequent preprocessing decisions.

Train–Test Split
----------------
A stratified split is applied to preserve class proportions, using 70% of the
data for training and 30% as a held-out test set. The test set is strictly
reserved for final evaluation and is never used during training.

Baseline Models
---------------
Two classical machine learning models are evaluated:

- Logistic Regression, serving as an interpretable linear baseline
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k = 5), serving as a simple non-parametric baseline

Feature scaling is applied using scikit-learn Pipelines to ensure consistency
and prevent data leakage.

Training and Evaluation
-----------------------
Models are trained exclusively on the training set and evaluated on the held-out
test set. Evaluation metrics include:

- Training and test accuracy
- Precision, recall, and F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrices
- False negative counts

Special emphasis is placed on false negatives (malignant cases predicted as
benign), as this represents the most critical error in a medical screening
context.

Results and Model Comparison
----------------------------
Phase 1 produces dataset-level exploratory visualizations, model-specific
evaluation outputs, and general comparison plots such as train vs test accuracy,
ROC curves, and false negative comparisons. A summary CSV file consolidates the
key metrics for all evaluated models.

Phase 1 Outcome
---------------
Both baseline models achieve strong overall performance. However, Logistic
Regression demonstrates better generalization and significantly fewer false
negatives compared to k-Nearest Neighbors. Given the clinical importance of
minimizing missed malignant cases, Logistic Regression is selected as the
strongest baseline model for Phase 1.

Design Philosophy
-----------------
Phase 1 prioritizes correctness, interpretability, and rigorous evaluation over
raw performance. The results serve as a validated baseline and reference point
for Phase 2, which explores stronger models and safety-aware optimization
strategies.
