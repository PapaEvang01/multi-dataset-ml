Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 1: Baseline Models (Tabular Data)

This phase implements the first stage of a structured, real-world machine learning
pipeline using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The primary objective
of Phase 1 is to establish strong, interpretable baseline models while validating the
quality of the data, preprocessing steps, and evaluation methodology before moving to
more complex approaches.

Problem Description:
Given numerical features extracted from breast tumor biopsies, such as radius,
texture, smoothness, and concavity, the task is to classify each sample into one of
two categories:

Malignant (0)

Benign (1)

Dataset:

Source: sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer

Total samples: 569

Total features: 30 numerical features

Target encoding:
0 corresponds to malignant
1 corresponds to benign

Phase 1 Workflow:
Phase 1 follows a disciplined machine learning workflow designed to emphasize
interpretability, generalization, and clinically meaningful evaluation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The dataset is inspected to understand its structure, feature distributions,
and class balance. Visualizations such as class distribution plots and feature
histograms are generated to identify scale differences, skewness, and potential
outliers. This analysis is performed prior to model training and informs
preprocessing decisions.

Train and Test Split
A stratified split is applied to preserve class proportions, using 70 percent
of the data for training and 30 percent as a held-out test set. The test set is
strictly reserved for final evaluation and is never used during training.

Baseline Models
Two classical machine learning models are evaluated:

Logistic Regression, used as an interpretable linear baseline

k-Nearest Neighbors (k=5), used as a simple non-parametric baseline
Feature scaling is applied through scikit-learn Pipelines to ensure consistency
and prevent data leakage.

Training and Evaluation
Models are trained exclusively on the training set and evaluated on the held-out
test set. Evaluation metrics include training accuracy, test accuracy, precision,
recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and false negative counts. Special
emphasis is placed on false negatives, where malignant cases are incorrectly
classified as benign, as this represents the most critical error in a medical
screening context.

Results and Model Comparison
Phase 1 produces dataset-level exploratory plots, model-specific evaluation
outputs, and general comparison visualizations such as train versus test accuracy,
ROC curves, and false negative comparisons. A summary CSV file consolidates the
key metrics for all evaluated models.

Phase 1 Outcome:
Both baseline models achieve high overall performance. However, Logistic Regression
demonstrates superior generalization and significantly fewer false negatives compared
to k-Nearest Neighbors. Given the clinical importance of minimizing missed malignant
cases, Logistic Regression is selected as the strongest baseline model for Phase 1.

Design Philosophy:
Phase 1 prioritizes correctness, interpretability, and rigorous evaluation over raw
performance. The results serve as a validated baseline and reference point for Phase 2,
which will explore more advanced models and optimization strategies.
