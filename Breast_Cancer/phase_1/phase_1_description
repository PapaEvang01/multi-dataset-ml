Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 1: Baseline Models (Tabular Data)

This script implements Phase 1 of a structured, real-world machine learning pipeline
using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The goal of this phase is to
establish strong, interpretable baseline models and verify the quality of the data
and evaluation setup before moving to more complex approaches.

Problem Description:
--------------------
Given numerical features extracted from breast tumor biopsies (e.g., radius, texture,
smoothness, concavity), the task is to classify each sample as either:
    - Malignant (0)
    - Benign (1)

Dataset:
--------
- Source: sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer
- Samples: 569
- Features: 30 numerical features
- Target convention (sklearn):
    0 -> malignant
    1 -> benign

Pipeline Overview:
------------------
1. Data Loading & Inspection
   - Load the dataset into pandas DataFrames
   - Print dataset shape, feature names, and class distribution
   - Display a small preview of the data
   - Plot basic exploratory figures (class distribution, feature histograms)

2. Train/Test Split
   - Stratified split to preserve class balance
   - 70% training set / 30% held-out test set
   - Test set is never used during training

3. Baseline Models (Phase 1)
   - Logistic Regression (interpretable linear baseline)
   - k-Nearest Neighbors (simple non-parametric baseline)
   - Feature scaling applied via sklearn Pipelines to prevent data leakage

4. Training & Evaluation
   - Models are trained exclusively on the training set
   - Evaluation performed on the held-out test set
   - Metrics reported:
       * Training accuracy
       * Test accuracy
       * Precision, Recall, F1-score
       * ROC-AUC (when available)
       * Confusion matrix
       * False negatives (malignant predicted as benign), which are critical in
         medical decision-support systems

5. Outputs
   - Confusion matrix plots per model
   - ROC curve comparison
   - Train vs test accuracy comparison
   - False negative comparison across models
   - Summary CSV with key metrics for all models

Design Philosophy:
------------------
This phase prioritizes correctness, interpretability, and evaluation discipline
over raw performance. The results of Phase 1 serve as a validated baseline and
reference point for Phase 2 (more advanced models and tuning).
