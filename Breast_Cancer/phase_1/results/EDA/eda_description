Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
------------------------------

This folder contains exploratory data analysis visualizations created to
understand the structure and properties of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
(Diagnostic) dataset prior to model training.

Contents:

- class_distribution.png
  Shows the distribution of malignant and benign samples, highlighting
  the moderate class imbalance in the dataset.

- hist_mean_radius.png
- hist_mean_perimeter.png
- hist_mean_area.png
- hist_mean_texture.png
- hist_mean_smoothness.png
  Histograms illustrating the distribution of selected numerical features.
  These plots are used to analyze feature ranges, variability, skewness,
  and the presence of outliers.

Notes:
EDA is performed before model training and does not depend on model
predictions. The insights gained from this analysis inform preprocessing
decisions such as feature scaling and model selection.
