k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN, k=5) — Phase 1 Results
------------------------------------------------

Model:
- Algorithm: k-Nearest Neighbors (k=5)
- Scaling: StandardScaler applied via sklearn Pipeline
- Split: Stratified 70% train / 30% test

Test Set Performance:
- Accuracy: 0.9591
- ROC-AUC: 0.9827
- Malignant recall (sensitivity): 0.8906
- False negatives (malignant → benign): 7
- False positives (benign → malignant): 0

Confusion Matrix (rows=true, cols=pred):
[[57  7]
 [ 0 107]]

The model achieves high overall performance and perfect specificity (no benign cases
flagged as malignant). However, it misses 7 malignant cases, which is a clinically
critical error type. This baseline is used as a reference point for comparing against
other models in Phase 1 and more advanced models in Phase 2.
