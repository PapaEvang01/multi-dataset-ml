General Evaluation Results — Phase 1
-----------------------------------

This folder contains evaluation plots and summary results used to compare
baseline models during Phase 1 of the project.

Contents:

- train_test_accuracy.png
  Comparison of training and test accuracy for each baseline model.
  This plot is used to assess generalization and detect overfitting.

- roc_curves.png
  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves computed on the test set.
  The Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarizes the overall separability of
  malignant and benign samples for each model.

- false_negatives.png
  Comparison of false negative counts across models (malignant cases
  incorrectly predicted as benign). This is a clinically critical metric
  used to guide model selection.

- phase1_summary.csv
  Summary table containing key evaluation metrics for all Phase 1 models,
  including accuracy, ROC-AUC, and false negatives.

These results demonstrate that Logistic Regression achieves superior
performance in terms of sensitivity and overall separability while
maintaining strong generalization. Based on these metrics, Logistic
Regression is selected as the strongest baseline model for Phase 1.
