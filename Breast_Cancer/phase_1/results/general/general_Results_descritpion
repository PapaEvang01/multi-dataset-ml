General Evaluation Results — Phase 1
-----------------------------------

This folder contains evaluation plots and summary results used to compare
baseline models during Phase 1 of the project.

Contents:

- train_test_accuracy.png
  Comparison of training and test accuracy for each baseline model.
  This plot is used to assess generalization and detect overfitting.

- roc_curves.png
  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves computed on the test set.
  The Area Under the Curve (AUC) summarizes the overall separability of
  malignant and benign samples for each model.

- false_negatives.png
  Comparison of false negative counts across models (malignant cases
  incorrectly predicted as benign). This is a clinically critical metric
  used to guide model selection.

- phase1_summary.csv
  Summary table containing key evaluation metrics for all Phase 1 models,
  including accuracy, ROC-AUC, and false negatives.

The Phase 1 evaluation demonstrates that both baseline models achieve high 
overall performance on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. 
However, clear differences emerge when clinically relevant metrics are considered. 
Logistic Regression shows excellent generalization, with nearly identical training 
and test accuracy, indicating stable and reliable behavior. 
It also achieves near-perfect class separability, as reflected by a very high ROC-AUC score.

Most importantly, Logistic Regression minimizes false negatives,
 misclassifying only one malignant case as benign, whereas the KNN model 
 misses seven malignant cases. Given that false negatives represent the 
 most critical error in a medical screening context, this difference is decisive. 
 Based on its superior sensitivity, strong generalization, and interpretability, 
 Logistic Regression is selected as the strongest baseline model for Phase 1.
