Random Forest Results — Phase 2: Threshold-Aware Evaluation

This file summarizes the results of the Random Forest classifier used in Phase 2
of the breast cancer classification pipeline. The focus of this phase is not only
on raw accuracy, but on medically informed decision-making through probability
threshold tuning.

Model Configuration:
--------------------
- Algorithm: Random Forest
- Number of trees (estimators): 100
- Maximum tree depth: 3
- Maximum features per split: 5
- Bootstrapping: Disabled
- Output: Class probabilities P(malignant), P(benign)

This configuration intentionally limits model complexity to reduce overfitting
and improve interpretability while maintaining strong performance.

Evaluation Setup:
-----------------
- Train/Test split: 70% / 30% (stratified)
- Positive class for probability analysis: malignant
- Metrics emphasized:
    * Accuracy
    * ROC-AUC
    * Confusion matrix
    * False negatives (malignant → predicted benign)
    * False positives (benign → predicted malignant)

Two evaluation regimes are reported:
1) Default decision threshold (0.5)
2) Tuned threshold optimized for medical safety

------------------------------------------------------------
1) Default Threshold Results (threshold = 0.5)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Test accuracy: 0.9298
- ROC-AUC: 0.9883
- Malignant recall (sensitivity): 0.9062
- Benign specificity: 0.9439

Confusion Matrix (rows=true, cols=pred):
    [[58  6]
     [ 6 101]]

- False negatives: 6
- False positives: 6

Interpretation:
---------------
Using the standard threshold yields balanced performance with high accuracy.
However, 6 malignant cases are incorrectly classified as benign, which is
undesirable in a medical screening context where missed cancers are critical.

------------------------------------------------------------
2) Tuned Threshold Results (threshold = 0.13)
------------------------------------------------------------
- Test accuracy: 0.9181
- ROC-AUC: 0.9883
- Malignant recall (sensitivity): 1.0000
- Benign specificity: 0.8692

Confusion Matrix (rows=true, cols=pred):
    [[64  0]
     [14 93]]

- False negatives: 0
- False positives: 14

Interpretation:
---------------
Lowering the decision threshold eliminates all false negatives, ensuring that
every malignant case is detected. This comes at the cost of increased false
positives, meaning more benign cases are flagged for further examination.

This trade-off is intentional and aligned with medical practice, where it is
preferable to trigger additional tests rather than miss a cancer diagnosis.

Key Takeaways:
--------------
- Random Forest provides strong baseline performance with excellent separability
  (high ROC-AUC).
- Threshold tuning enables explicit control over clinical risk.
- Eliminating false negatives is achievable without retraining the model.
- The model demonstrates how probability calibration and decision thresholds are
  as important as the classifier itself in real-world medical systems.

Role in the Project:
--------------------
Random Forest serves as a robust non-linear ensemble baseline in Phase 2 and
provides a clear comparison point for SVM-based threshold tuning. Its behavior
highlights the importance of evaluation discipline over naive accuracy metrics.

These results will inform later phases involving model selection, comparison,
and potential deployment-oriented decision policies.
