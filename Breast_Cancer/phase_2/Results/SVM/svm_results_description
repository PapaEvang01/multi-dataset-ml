SVM Results — Phase 2 (Threshold Tuning & Medical Trade-offs)
=============================================================

This file summarizes the results of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model
with an RBF kernel evaluated in Phase 2 of the project. The analysis focuses
not only on predictive performance, but also on clinically relevant decision
trade-offs achieved through threshold tuning.

Model Configuration
-------------------
- Model: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
- Input: Standardized numerical features (via StandardScaler)
- Output: Class probabilities for malignant (0) and benign (1)

Baseline Evaluation (Default Threshold = 0.5)
---------------------------------------------
At the default decision threshold (P(malignant) ≥ 0.5), the SVM model achieves
very strong overall performance on the test set.

Key results:
- Test accuracy: 0.9766
- ROC-AUC (positive class = benign): 0.9978
- Malignant recall (sensitivity): 0.9688
- False negatives (malignant → benign): 2
- False positives (benign → malignant): 2

The confusion matrix at threshold 0.5 shows that the model is well-balanced,
with only a small number of misclassifications in both directions. However,
even a small number of false negatives is considered critical in a medical
screening context.

Threshold Tuning (Medical Discipline)
-------------------------------------
To reduce the risk of missing malignant cases, a threshold tuning procedure
was applied. Instead of using the default 0.5 threshold, the decision boundary
was shifted to prioritize malignant detection.

The tuning objective followed this strict order:
1. Minimize false negatives (malignant → benign)
2. Minimize false positives (benign → malignant)
3. Preserve overall accuracy where possible

Based on this criterion, the selected threshold was:
- Tuned threshold on P(malignant): 0.15

Tuned Evaluation Results
-----------------------
After applying the tuned threshold, the model achieves perfect malignant
detection on the test set.

Key results:
- Test accuracy: 0.9357
- Malignant recall (sensitivity): 1.0000
- False negatives (malignant → benign): 0
- False positives (benign → malignant): 11
- Benign specificity: 0.8972

This confirms the expected and intentional trade-off: false negatives are
completely eliminated at the cost of an increased number of false positives.
Such behavior is often preferable in medical decision-support systems, where
missing a malignant case is far more costly than raising additional alerts.

Interpretation of Plots
-----------------------
- Confusion matrices (default vs tuned):
  Visualize how threshold tuning shifts errors from false negatives to
  false positives.

- FN/FP vs threshold plot:
  Demonstrates the inverse relationship between false negatives and false
  positives as the threshold changes.

- Accuracy vs threshold plot:
  Shows that accuracy remains relatively high across a range of thresholds,
  allowing safer operating points without catastrophic performance loss.

Conclusion
----------
The SVM model demonstrates excellent class separability on this dataset.
Threshold tuning transforms it from a high-accuracy classifier into a
risk-aware medical decision-support tool. This experiment highlights that
model evaluation should not rely solely on accuracy, but must consider
application-specific costs of different error types.

The SVM results from Phase 2 provide a strong reference point for comparing
against other advanced models, such as Random Forest, under safety-oriented
evaluation criteria.
