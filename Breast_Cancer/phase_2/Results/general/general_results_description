General Results — Phase 2: Advanced Models & Threshold Tuning

This folder summarizes the overall results of Phase 2, where more powerful
classification models are evaluated under a medically informed decision framework.

Phase 2 extends the baseline analysis (Phase 1) by introducing:
- Non-linear and ensemble models
- Probability-based decision making
- Explicit control of the false negative rate through threshold tuning

Models Evaluated:
-----------------
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel
2. Random Forest (100 trees, max depth = 3, 5 features per split, no bootstrapping)

Both models are trained on the same train/test split used in Phase 1 to ensure
a fair and consistent comparison.

Key Results & Visualizations:
-----------------------------
- train_test_accuracy.png
  Comparison of training accuracy and test accuracy under:
    • Default decision threshold (0.5)
    • Tuned decision threshold (optimized for medical safety)

  This plot highlights the trade-off between raw accuracy and clinically
  motivated decision rules.

- Confusion Matrices (default vs tuned threshold)
  Confusion matrices are reported for each model under:
    • Threshold = 0.5 (standard classification)
    • Tuned threshold (reduced false negatives)

  The tuned threshold prioritizes minimizing malignant cases incorrectly
  classified as benign.

- FN / FP vs Threshold plots
  These plots show how false negatives and false positives evolve as the
  decision threshold on P(malignant) changes.

  They explicitly illustrate the medical trade-off:
    • Lower threshold → fewer false negatives, more false positives
    • Higher threshold → fewer false positives, more false negatives

- Accuracy vs Threshold plots
  Accuracy is plotted across a range of thresholds to show how overall
  performance changes when the decision rule is adjusted.

Summary Table:

- phase2_summary.csv
  Consolidated table reporting key metrics for all Phase 2 models, including:
    • Train accuracy
    • Test accuracy (default threshold)
    • Test accuracy (tuned threshold)
    • False negatives
    • False positives

Interpretation:
---------------
Although threshold tuning may slightly reduce overall accuracy, it significantly
reduces or eliminates false negatives. In a medical decision-support context,
this trade-off is intentional and desirable, as missing a malignant case is
considered more costly than a false alarm.

Phase 2 demonstrates that model evaluation must go beyond accuracy alone and
incorporate domain-specific risk considerations.

These results provide a strong foundation for future phases involving
calibration, interpretability, and more advanced validation strategies.
