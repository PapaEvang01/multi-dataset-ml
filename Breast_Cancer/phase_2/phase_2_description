Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 2: Advanced Models & Medical Threshold Tuning

This phase builds upon the validated baselines established in Phase 1 by introducing
more expressive machine learning models and incorporating medically informed decision
rules. The primary focus of Phase 2 is not only improving predictive power, but also
aligning model behavior with real-world clinical priorities.

Problem Context:
----------------
The task remains binary classification of breast tumor biopsy samples as:
    - Malignant (0)
    - Benign (1)

In medical decision-support systems, false negatives (malignant cases incorrectly
classified as benign) are significantly more costly than false positives. Therefore,
Phase 2 explicitly addresses decision thresholds rather than relying solely on default
classification rules.

Models Introduced:
------------------
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel
   - Non-linear classifier capable of capturing complex feature interactions
   - Probability estimates enabled for threshold analysis

2. Random Forest Classifier
   - Ensemble of 100 decision trees
   - Maximum depth per tree: 3
   - Maximum features per split: 5
   - Bootstrapping disabled to emphasize deterministic learning behavior
   - Designed to reduce variance while maintaining interpretability

Methodology Overview:
---------------------
1. Data Preparation
   - Same dataset, preprocessing steps, and train/test split as Phase 1
   - Feature scaling applied where required (SVM) to ensure numerical stability
   - Test set strictly held out and never used during training or tuning

2. Model Training
   - Models trained exclusively on the training set
   - Training accuracy recorded to monitor potential overfitting

3. Probability-Based Prediction
   - Instead of hard class labels, predicted probabilities P(malignant) are computed
   - Enables flexible decision thresholds beyond the default value of 0.5

4. Threshold Tuning (Medical Discipline)
   - A range of thresholds is evaluated for each model
   - For each threshold, the following are computed on the test set:
       * Accuracy
       * False negatives (malignant → benign)
       * False positives (benign → malignant)

   - Thresholds are selected to minimize false negatives while maintaining
     acceptable overall performance

5. Evaluation Metrics
   - Train accuracy
   - Test accuracy (default threshold = 0.5)
   - Test accuracy (tuned threshold)
   - Confusion matrices
   - False negative and false positive counts
   - Accuracy vs threshold curves
   - FN / FP vs threshold curves

Results Summary:
----------------
- Both SVM and Random Forest achieve high training accuracy, indicating strong
  modeling capacity.
- Default threshold evaluation yields high test accuracy but allows non-zero
  false negatives.
- Threshold tuning successfully reduces or eliminates false negatives for both models,
  at the cost of increased false positives and slightly reduced accuracy.
- The trade-off is intentional and aligns with clinical safety requirements.

These results demonstrate that model selection and evaluation must be guided by
domain-specific risk considerations rather than accuracy alone.

Design Philosophy:
------------------
Phase 2 emphasizes:
- Controlled experimentation
- Separation of training and evaluation
- Transparency in decision rules
- Explicit modeling of real-world costs

Rather than optimizing purely for performance metrics, this phase prioritizes
responsible and interpretable machine learning suitable for medical applications.

Phase 2 serves as a bridge between baseline modeling and more advanced topics such as:
- Model calibration
- Interpretability (feature importance, SHAP)
- Robust validation strategies
- Deployment-oriented decision logic
