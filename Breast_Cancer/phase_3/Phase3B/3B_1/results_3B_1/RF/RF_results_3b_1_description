Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 3B.1
Global Model Explainability (Random Forest)

Overview
--------
Phase 3B.1 focuses on *global explainability* for the Random Forest model using
Permutation Importance. The goal is to understand which input features the model
relies on most, both for overall predictive accuracy and for clinically critical
performance (malignant recall).

Permutation importance measures how much model performance degrades when a single
feature is randomly shuffled. A larger performance drop indicates stronger reliance
on that feature.

Two perspectives are analyzed:
  1) Importance with respect to overall Accuracy
  2) Importance with respect to Malignant Recall (sensitivity for class 0)

This distinction is crucial in medical AI, where features important for catching
malignant cases may differ from those that optimize overall accuracy.

Results — Accuracy-Based Importance
-----------------------------------
When evaluated using accuracy as the performance metric, the Random Forest model
relies most strongly on features describing tumor size and shape irregularity.

Top contributing features:
  - worst area
  - worst concave points
  - worst radius

These features represent extreme (worst-case) measurements of tumor geometry,
indicating that the model uses size and boundary irregularity as primary signals
for correct classification across all samples.

Most remaining features show near-zero importance, suggesting that the Random Forest
effectively concentrates decision-making on a small subset of highly informative
features.

Results — Malignant Recall Importance
-------------------------------------
When importance is measured with respect to malignant recall (i.e., the ability to
correctly identify malignant tumors), a slightly different pattern emerges.

Top contributing features:
  - worst concave points
  - worst area
  - worst perimeter
  - worst radius

The dominance of *worst concave points* indicates that boundary sharpness and local
irregularities are particularly critical for detecting malignancies, even more so
than for overall accuracy.

This confirms that the model leverages different feature signals depending on whether
the objective is global correctness or minimizing false negatives.

Key Insights
------------
- The Random Forest relies heavily on "worst" tumor measurements rather than mean
  values, aligning with clinical intuition that extreme morphological characteristics
  are more indicative of malignancy.
- Features important for malignant recall are not identical to those optimizing
  accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between safety-oriented and performance-oriented
  objectives.
- Many features contribute little or nothing to the final decision, suggesting that
  the model learns a sparse, interpretable structure despite being an ensemble method.

Connection to Phase 3B.2
------------------------
This global feature analysis provides the foundation for Phase 3B.2, where local
explanations (per-sample analysis) will be applied to:
  - false positives
  - borderline cases
  - hard examples near the decision boundary

Together, Phase 3B.1 and Phase 3B.2 move the project from performance evaluation
toward transparent, clinically interpretable decision support.
