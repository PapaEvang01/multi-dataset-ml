Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 3B.1
Global Explainability Results (SVM_RBF)

Overview
--------
This phase analyzes the global behavior of the SVM (RBF kernel) model using
Permutation Feature Importance. The goal is to understand which input features
the model relies on most, both for overall accuracy and for detecting malignant
cases (recall of the malignant class).

Permutation importance measures how much model performance drops when a feature
is randomly shuffled. A larger drop indicates that the model depends more
strongly on that feature.

Two perspectives are evaluated:
  1) Overall accuracy
  2) Malignant recall (sensitivity for class 0)

This distinction is critical in medical applications, where the features that
maximize accuracy may differ from those that reduce false negatives.

--------------------------------------------------
Top Features by Accuracy Importance
--------------------------------------------------
The following features caused the largest drop in accuracy when permuted:

- worst texture
- radius error
- area error
- perimeter error
- mean texture
- worst smoothness
- mean concave points
- worst concavity
- mean concavity
- worst concave points

These results indicate that the SVM relies heavily on texture-related features
and measurement variability (error features) to achieve strong overall
classification performance.

--------------------------------------------------
Top Features by Malignant Recall Importance
--------------------------------------------------
When optimizing specifically for malignant recall, a slightly different feature
ranking emerges:

- worst texture
- worst concave points
- worst smoothness
- worst concavity
- mean texture
- radius error
- mean concavity
- perimeter error
- mean concave points
- worst radius

This highlights that shape irregularity, concavity, and surface roughness are
particularly important for identifying malignant tumors and avoiding false
negatives.

--------------------------------------------------
Key Observations
--------------------------------------------------
- The SVM uses different feature signals for overall correctness versus malignant
  detection.
- Texture and concavity-related features consistently appear among the most
  important, aligning well with known clinical indicators of malignancy.
- Error-based features (e.g., radius error, area error) play a significant role,
  suggesting that variability and uncertainty in measurements carry diagnostic
  value.
- The presence of different top features for accuracy vs recall justifies the
  use of recall-focused evaluation in medical AI.

--------------------------------------------------
Why This Matters
--------------------------------------------------
These results demonstrate that the SVM model is not a black box:
its decisions are driven by clinically meaningful features.

This global explainability analysis provides a strong foundation for:
  - Phase 3B.2: Local explanations on hard and borderline cases
  - Trustworthy, safety-aware deployment in medical decision support systems
