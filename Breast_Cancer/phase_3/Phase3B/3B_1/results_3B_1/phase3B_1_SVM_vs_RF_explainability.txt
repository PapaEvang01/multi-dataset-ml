Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 3B.1
Explainability Comparison: SVM (RBF) vs Random Forest

Overview
--------
This section compares the global explainability behavior of two models:
  - Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel)
  - Random Forest

Both models were analyzed using Permutation Feature Importance under two
objectives:
  1) Overall accuracy
  2) Malignant recall (sensitivity)

The goal is to understand not only which features matter, but how each model
uses them differently.

--------------------------------------------------
1. Feature Usage Pattern
--------------------------------------------------

SVM (RBF):
- Relies on a broad set of features.
- Strong importance assigned to:
    • Texture-related features
    • Error-based features (radius error, area error, perimeter error)
    • Concavity-related features
- Importance is distributed across many variables.

Random Forest:
- Focuses on a smaller, more compact feature set.
- Dominated by:
    • worst area
    • worst concave points
    • worst perimeter / radius (secondary)
- Importance is more concentrated on extreme shape measurements.

Interpretation:
SVM captures subtle, distributed patterns,
while Random Forest emphasizes dominant geometric characteristics.

--------------------------------------------------
2. Accuracy vs Malignant Recall Sensitivity
--------------------------------------------------

SVM (RBF):
- Shows a clear shift in feature importance when optimizing for malignant recall.
- Texture, concavity, and smoothness become more dominant for recall.
- Indicates sensitivity to fine-grained morphological cues.

Random Forest:
- Feature ranking remains relatively stable between accuracy and recall.
- worst concave points consistently dominates malignant recall.
- Indicates a more rigid decision structure.

Interpretation:
SVM adapts feature usage based on the clinical objective,
while Random Forest remains more rule-driven.

--------------------------------------------------
3. Clinical Interpretability
--------------------------------------------------

SVM (RBF):
- Uses clinically meaningful features but in a more abstract combination.
- Harder to explain individual decisions.
- Better at capturing nuanced tumor characteristics.

Random Forest:
- Highly interpretable feature dominance.
- Clear linkage between decisions and known cancer indicators.
- Easier to explain to clinicians.

--------------------------------------------------
4. Robustness and Trust
--------------------------------------------------

SVM (RBF):
- Sensitive to measurement variability (error features).
- May generalize better on complex cases.
- Requires additional local explanation tools for trust.

Random Forest:
- Robust, stable feature reliance.
- Decisions easier to justify.
- Slightly less flexible in borderline scenarios.

--------------------------------------------------
Final Takeaway
--------------------------------------------------

- Random Forest behaves as a conservative, rule-based model relying on
  strong geometric indicators of malignancy.
- SVM (RBF) behaves as a flexible pattern learner, integrating texture,
  concavity, and measurement variability.
- The models are complementary:
    • Random Forest provides transparency and stability.
    • SVM provides sensitivity and nuanced discrimination.

This comparison motivates the next step:
