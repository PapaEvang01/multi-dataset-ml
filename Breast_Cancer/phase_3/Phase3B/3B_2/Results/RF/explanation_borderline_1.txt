======================================================================

Case type: borderline
Test-set index: 1
Baseline P(malignant): 0.0191

Top contributing features (permutation-based):
(Positive = increases malignancy probability)

- worst concave points: -0.10366 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst area: -0.06547 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst radius: -0.05062 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean perimeter: -0.02779 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst concavity: -0.02531 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean area: -0.02424 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean concave points: -0.02319 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean radius: -0.01873 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean concavity: -0.01325 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- area error: -0.01279 (↓ decreases malignancy)

Interpretation:
The listed features had the strongest influence on this individual prediction. Large positive contributions pushed the model toward a malignant decision, while negative contributions counteracted it.
