Local Explanation — RandomForest
======================================================================

Case type: false_positive
Test-set index: 0
Baseline P(malignant): 0.7620

Top contributing features (permutation-based):
(Positive = increases malignancy probability)

- worst concave points: +0.21447 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean concave points: +0.09441 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst compactness: +0.05934 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst concavity: +0.05693 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst smoothness: +0.04121 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst area: -0.03437 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean smoothness: +0.03037 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean concavity: +0.02984 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst texture: +0.02944 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst fractal dimension: +0.02509 (↑ increases malignancy)

Interpretation:
The listed features had the strongest influence on this individual prediction. Large positive contributions pushed the model toward a malignant decision, while negative contributions counteracted it.
