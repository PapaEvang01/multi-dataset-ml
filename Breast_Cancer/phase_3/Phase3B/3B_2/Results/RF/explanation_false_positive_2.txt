Case type: false_positive
Test-set index: 2
Baseline P(malignant): 0.1134

Top contributing features (permutation-based):
(Positive = increases malignancy probability)

- worst concave points: -0.08910 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst area: -0.05387 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst concavity: -0.03305 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst radius: -0.03098 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean area: -0.02711 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean concave points: +0.02546 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean perimeter: -0.02433 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- area error: +0.02258 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean radius: -0.02010 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst perimeter: -0.01991 (↓ decreases malignancy)

Interpretation:
The listed features had the strongest influence on this individual prediction. Large positive contributions pushed the model toward a malignant decision, while negative contributions counteracted it.
