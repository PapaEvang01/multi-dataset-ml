Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 3B.2
Local Explainability Results (RandomForest)

Overview

This phase analyzes the local, sample-level behavior of the Random Forest model,
focusing on difficult cases identified in Phase 3A. While Phase 3B.1 examined which
features influence the model globally, Phase 3B.2 explains why specific decisions
were made for individual test samples.

The analysis targets:

False Positive cases (benign → predicted malignant)

Borderline cases (samples close to the decision threshold)

Local explanations are generated using a permutation-based feature influence method,
measuring how perturbations of individual features affect the predicted probability
of malignancy for a single sample.

False Positive Case Explanations

For false positive cases, the Random Forest model’s decisions are dominated by
shape- and size-related tumor features.

The most influential features consistently include:

worst concave points

worst area

worst radius

worst concavity

mean concave points

In many false positive cases, the strongest contributions are negative, meaning
that several features reduce the malignancy probability. However, smaller positive
contributions from correlated concavity and compactness features are sufficient to
push the final prediction above the malignancy threshold.

This indicates that false positives are not caused by a single extreme feature, but
by the combined effect of multiple weak and correlated signals, reflecting a
conservative decision strategy.

Borderline Case Explanations

Borderline cases show a clearer balance between features that increase and decrease
malignancy probability.

Features increasing malignancy probability commonly include:

worst concave points

mean concave points

worst compactness

worst concavity

worst smoothness

Features decreasing malignancy probability are typically related to:

tumor size (worst area, worst radius)

global perimeter measurements

These cases lie naturally close to the decision boundary, where modest changes in a
few features could flip the predicted class. This behavior reflects genuine
diagnostic ambiguity rather than unstable or noisy model behavior.

Key Observations

The Random Forest relies heavily on extreme geometric and boundary-related
features at the individual sample level.

Local explanations reveal a structured but rigid decision logic, with concavity
measures playing a central role.

False positives arise from conservative aggregation of weak malignancy signals,
consistent with a safety-oriented objective.

Borderline cases highlight regions of overlapping benign and malignant feature
characteristics.

Why This Matters

Phase 3B.2 demonstrates that the Random Forest model’s individual predictions are
locally interpretable and clinically meaningful. The explanations confirm alignment
with a safety-focused diagnostic strategy, where avoiding missed malignant cases is
prioritized, even at the cost of increased false positives.

This local explainability analysis strengthens trust in the model and supports its
use as a transparent medical decision-support system.
