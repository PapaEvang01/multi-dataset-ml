Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 3B.2
Local Explainability Results (RandomForest)

Overview
--------
This phase focuses on *local explainability* for the Random Forest model.
Rather than analyzing global feature importance, Phase 3B.2 explains *individual
model decisions* for difficult test samples identified in Phase 3A.

The analysis targets two clinically important case types:
  - False Positives (benign samples predicted as malignant)
  - Borderline cases (samples with P(malignant) close to the tuned threshold)

Local explanations are generated using permutation-based feature influence,
measuring how perturbing each feature affects the predicted probability of
malignancy for a single sample.

--------------------------------------------------
Methodology
--------------------------------------------------
For each selected hard case:
  - The baseline P(malignant) is recorded
  - Each feature is permuted using values from the training set
  - The average change in P(malignant) is measured
  - Features are ranked by absolute influence

Positive contributions increase malignancy probability,
while negative contributions reduce it.

--------------------------------------------------
False Positive Case Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
Across false positive cases, the Random Forest model’s predictions are dominated
by shape- and size-related tumor characteristics.

The most influential features consistently include:
- worst concave points
- worst area
- worst radius
- worst concavity
- mean concave points

In many false positive cases, several strong negative contributions reduce
malignancy probability. However, multiple weaker positive contributions from
correlated concavity and compactness features combine to push the final prediction
above the malignancy threshold.

This indicates that false positives are not driven by a single extreme feature,
but by the cumulative effect of multiple moderately suspicious signals, reflecting
a conservative aggregation strategy.

--------------------------------------------------
Borderline Case Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
Borderline cases show a clearer balance between features that increase and
decrease malignancy probability.

Features commonly increasing malignancy probability include:
- worst concave points
- mean concave points
- worst compactness
- worst concavity
- worst smoothness

Features decreasing malignancy probability are typically associated with:
- tumor size (worst area, worst radius)
- global perimeter measurements

These cases lie naturally close to the decision boundary, where modest changes
in a small number of features could flip the predicted class. This behavior
reflects genuine diagnostic ambiguity rather than unstable model behavior.

--------------------------------------------------
Key Observations
--------------------------------------------------
- The Random Forest relies strongly on extreme geometric and boundary-related
  features at the individual sample level.
- Local explanations reveal a structured and consistent decision logic, with
  concavity-based features playing a central role.
- False positives arise from conservative aggregation of multiple weak malignancy
  signals, consistent with a safety-oriented objective.
- Borderline cases highlight regions of overlapping benign and malignant feature
  characteristics.

--------------------------------------------------
Why This Matters
--------------------------------------------------
Phase 3B.2 demonstrates that the Random Forest model is locally interpretable:
each individual prediction can be traced back to meaningful feature contributions.

The explanations confirm alignment with a safety-focused diagnostic strategy,
where minimizing missed malignant cases is prioritized, even at the cost of
additional false positives.

This local explainability analysis strengthens trust in the model and supports
its use as a transparent medical decision-support system.
