Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 3B.2
Local Explainability Comparison: SVM (RBF) vs Random Forest

Overview
--------
This section compares the local explainability behavior of two classical models:
  - Support Vector Machine (RBF kernel)
  - Random Forest

Both models were analyzed using the same local, permutation-based explanation
method on identical hard cases identified in Phase 3A (false positives and
borderline samples). This ensures a fair and reproducible comparison.

The goal is to understand *how* and *why* each model arrives at its decisions
at the individual sample level, and how their decision logic differs in
clinically ambiguous situations.

--------------------------------------------------
False Positive Case Behavior
--------------------------------------------------
SVM (RBF):
- False positive explanations are typically dominated by a small number of
  high-impact features.
- Texture- and concavity-related features often show strong positive influence,
  pushing the decision toward malignancy.
- Contributions tend to be sharper and more concentrated, indicating that the
  SVM relies on specific feature patterns that closely resemble malignant cases.

Random Forest:
- False positives arise from the aggregation of many weaker signals rather than
  a single dominant feature.
- Shape-related features (e.g., concave points, area, radius) collectively push
  the prediction above the malignancy threshold.
- This reflects an ensemble-based, conservative decision strategy.

Interpretation:
- SVM false positives are driven by strong similarity to malignant feature
  profiles.
- Random Forest false positives result from cumulative weak evidence rather than
  extreme feature values.

--------------------------------------------------
Borderline Case Behavior
--------------------------------------------------
SVM (RBF):
- Borderline cases often show a clear competition between a few strong positive
  and negative feature contributions.
- Small changes in key texture or concavity features can decisively flip the
  prediction.
- This indicates a sharper decision boundary and higher sensitivity to local
  feature variations.

Random Forest:
- Borderline cases exhibit a smoother balance of contributions across multiple
  features.
- No single feature dominates; instead, decisions emerge from averaged behavior
  across trees.
- This leads to more stable but less decisive boundaries near the threshold.

Interpretation:
- The SVM behaves more decisively but is also more sensitive near the boundary.
- The Random Forest shows greater stability but increased conservatism.

--------------------------------------------------
Model Decision Style Comparison
--------------------------------------------------
SVM (RBF):
- Local decisions are driven by a small set of influential features.
- Explanations are compact and easier to interpret at the individual level.
- Higher sensitivity to subtle feature changes near the decision boundary.

Random Forest:
- Local decisions are distributed across many features.
- Explanations reflect ensemble averaging rather than single-feature dominance.
- More robust but less sharp decision transitions.

--------------------------------------------------
Clinical Perspective
--------------------------------------------------
From a medical decision-support standpoint:

- The SVM offers clearer, more localized explanations that may be easier to
  communicate to clinicians on a per-case basis.
- The Random Forest provides more conservative decisions, reducing the risk of
  missed malignant cases at the cost of increased false positives.

Both behaviors are clinically meaningful and complementary, suggesting that
model choice should be guided by the desired balance between sensitivity,
stability, and interpretability.

--------------------------------------------------
Why This Matters
--------------------------------------------------
This comparison demonstrates that local explainability reveals *fundamental
differences* in how models reason, even when trained on the same data and
optimized under the same medical objective.

Understanding these differences is critical for:
  - Trustworthy deployment in clinical workflows
  - Selecting models aligned with safety priorities
  - Designing hybrid or ensemble decision-support systems

Phase 3B.2 confirms that both SVM and Random Forest are locally interpretable,
but they express risk, uncertainty, and evidence in distinct and informative ways.
