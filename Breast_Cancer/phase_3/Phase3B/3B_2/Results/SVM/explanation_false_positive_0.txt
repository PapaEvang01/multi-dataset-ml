Local Explanation — SVM_RBF
======================================================================

Case type: false_positive
Test-set index: 0
Baseline P(malignant): 0.9893

Top contributing features (permutation-based):
(Positive = increases malignancy probability)

- worst smoothness: +0.04083 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst concave points: +0.01902 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst compactness: +0.01794 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst concavity: +0.01663 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst fractal dimension: +0.01526 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean smoothness: +0.01419 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst symmetry: +0.01105 (↑ increases malignancy)
- worst texture: +0.01090 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean concavity: +0.00815 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean concave points: +0.00765 (↑ increases malignancy)

Interpretation:
The listed features had the strongest influence on this individual prediction. Large positive contributions pushed the model toward a malignant decision, while negative contributions counteracted it.
