Local Explanation — SVM_RBF
======================================================================

Case type: false_positive
Test-set index: 1
Baseline P(malignant): 0.0502

Top contributing features (permutation-based):
(Positive = increases malignancy probability)

- worst area: -0.08729 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst concave points: -0.04369 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean concavity: -0.03880 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst concavity: -0.03375 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean concave points: -0.02786 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean texture: -0.02749 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean symmetry: +0.02716 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean perimeter: -0.02291 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst texture: -0.02169 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean area: -0.01971 (↓ decreases malignancy)

Interpretation:
The listed features had the strongest influence on this individual prediction. Large positive contributions pushed the model toward a malignant decision, while negative contributions counteracted it.
