Local Explanation — SVM_RBF
======================================================================

Case type: false_positive
Test-set index: 2
Baseline P(malignant): 0.0818

Top contributing features (permutation-based):
(Positive = increases malignancy probability)

- worst area: -0.08114 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean texture: -0.04614 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst texture: -0.03964 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- radius error: +0.03248 (↑ increases malignancy)
- mean perimeter: -0.03221 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean concavity: -0.02925 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst radius: -0.02706 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- mean area: -0.02675 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst concave points: -0.02434 (↓ decreases malignancy)
- worst concavity: -0.02414 (↓ decreases malignancy)

Interpretation:
The listed features had the strongest influence on this individual prediction. Large positive contributions pushed the model toward a malignant decision, while negative contributions counteracted it.
