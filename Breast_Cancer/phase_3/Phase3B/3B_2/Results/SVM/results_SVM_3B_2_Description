Breast Cancer Classification — Phase 3B.2
Local Explainability Results (SVM_RBF)

Overview
--------
This phase focuses on *local explainability* for the SVM (RBF kernel) model.
Rather than analyzing global feature importance, Phase 3B.2 explains *individual
model decisions* for difficult test samples identified in Phase 3A.

The analysis targets two clinically important case types:
  - False Positives (benign samples predicted as malignant)
  - Borderline cases (samples with P(malignant) close to the tuned threshold)

Local explanations are generated using permutation-based feature influence,
measuring how perturbing each feature affects the predicted probability of
malignancy for a single sample.

--------------------------------------------------
Methodology
--------------------------------------------------
For each selected hard case:
  - The baseline P(malignant) is recorded
  - Each feature is permuted using values from the training set
  - The average change in P(malignant) is measured
  - Features are ranked by absolute influence

Positive contributions increase malignancy probability,
while negative contributions push the model toward a benign decision.

--------------------------------------------------
False Positive Case Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
Across false positive cases, the SVM frequently assigns high malignancy
probability due to strong influence from:

- Texture-related features (mean texture, worst texture)
- Shape irregularity indicators (worst concave points, mean concavity)
- Measurement variability features (radius error, area error)

In several cases, these features dominate the prediction even when other
features counteract malignancy, leading to conservative (over-alerting)
decisions.

--------------------------------------------------
Borderline Case Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
Borderline cases typically exhibit:
  - Very low baseline P(malignant)
  - Competing feature influences with similar magnitudes
  - Small changes in probability caused by individual features

Common patterns include:
  - Concavity and texture features decreasing malignancy probability
  - Symmetry or error-based features slightly increasing malignancy probability

These cases lie close to the decision boundary and represent genuine diagnostic
ambiguity rather than clear model failure.

--------------------------------------------------
Key Observations
--------------------------------------------------
- Local explanations confirm that SVM decisions are driven by clinically
  meaningful features rather than noise.
- Texture and concavity-related features repeatedly dominate individual
  predictions, consistent with global explainability findings.
- Borderline cases reflect conflicting feature signals, explaining why threshold
  tuning has a strong effect on final predictions.
- False positives arise from cautious behavior when high-risk feature patterns
  are partially present.

--------------------------------------------------
Why This Matters
--------------------------------------------------
Phase 3B.2 demonstrates that the SVM model is locally interpretable:
each individual prediction can be traced back to specific feature contributions.
