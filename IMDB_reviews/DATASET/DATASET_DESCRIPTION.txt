IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset
===========================

1. Overview
-----------

The IMDB Movie Reviews dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for
binary sentiment classification in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The task consists of classifying movie reviews as either:

    - Positive (pos)
    - Negative (neg)

This dataset is commonly used to evaluate text representation methods
such as TF-IDF as well as classical and deep learning models.


2. Dataset Structure
--------------------

The dataset contains 50,000 labeled English-language movie reviews.

It is balanced:
    - 25,000 positive reviews
    - 25,000 negative reviews

The data is already split into:

    - train/  (25,000 reviews)
    - test/   (25,000 reviews)

Each review is stored as a separate .txt file.

Folder structure:

    aclImdb/
        train/
            pos/
            neg/
        test/
            pos/
            neg/


3. Characteristics
------------------

- Real-world user-generated content
- Contains informal language and varied writing styles
- Includes sarcasm, mixed sentiment, and ambiguous phrasing
- Balanced class distribution

Because the data is unstructured text, it requires preprocessing and
feature extraction before being used in machine learning models.


4. Challenges
-------------

Sentiment analysis on this dataset is challenging due to:

- Negation handling (e.g., "not good")
- Sarcasm and irony
- Mixed sentiment within a single review
- Very short or vague reviews
- Informal grammar and spelling

These characteristics make the dataset suitable for evaluating
text representation techniques and classification robustness.


5. Usage in This Project
------------------------

In this project, the IMDB dataset is used to:

- Implement a full NLP pipeline
- Apply text preprocessing (cleaning and normalization)
- Transform text into numerical features using TF-IDF
- Train a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluate classification performance
- Analyze the most influential words using model coefficients

The dataset serves as the text modality component of a
multi-modal machine learning portfolio, alongside:

    - MNIST (image classification)
    - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (tabular classification)
