IMDB Movie Reviews — Sentiment Analysis Project
1. Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze and classify movie reviews based on their sentiment (positive or negative) using natural language processing techniques.

Unlike previous projects focused on image and tabular data, this work emphasizes text understanding, language representation, and data-driven decision making in unstructured data.
