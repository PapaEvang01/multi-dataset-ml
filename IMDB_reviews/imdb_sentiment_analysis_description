IMDB Sentiment Analysis
Project Description
===========================


1. Project Overview
-------------------

This project implements a complete Natural Language Processing (NLP)
pipeline for binary sentiment classification using the IMDB Movie
Reviews dataset.

The objective is to classify movie reviews as either:

    - Positive (pos)
    - Negative (neg)

The project emphasizes clean architecture, modular design,
reproducibility, and model interpretability rather than
overly complex modeling.


2. Motivation
-------------

Unlike image and tabular datasets, text data is unstructured and
requires specialized preprocessing and feature engineering.

This project demonstrates the ability to:

    - Handle raw text data
    - Perform text normalization
    - Transform text into numerical features
    - Train and evaluate classification models
    - Interpret model decisions using learned coefficients

It represents the text modality component of a
multi-domain machine learning portfolio.


3. Dataset
----------

Dataset:
    IMDB Movie Reviews (Stanford University)

Size:
    50,000 labeled reviews
    - 25,000 positive
    - 25,000 negative

Structure:
    Pre-split into training and test sets.

The dataset contains real-world user-generated content,
including sarcasm, mixed sentiment, and informal language.


4. Methodology
--------------

The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

    1. Data Loading
       - Load reviews from disk
       - Clean HTML artifacts
       - Normalize text

    2. Feature Engineering
       - Convert text to numerical vectors using TF-IDF
       - Limit vocabulary size for stability and efficiency

    3. Model Training
       - Train Logistic Regression classifier
       - Use stratified train/test split

    4. Evaluation
       - Compute accuracy
       - Compute precision, recall, and F1-score
       - Generate confusion matrix
       - Save all metrics automatically

    5. Model Interpretation
       - Extract most influential words
       - Identify top positive and negative indicators


5. Results
----------

Baseline Accuracy:
    ~89.8%

Performance is balanced across both classes,
with similar precision and recall values.

The model successfully captures strong sentiment indicators
such as:

    Positive: great, excellent, amazing, wonderful
    Negative: worst, bad, awful, boring

This confirms that TF-IDF combined with Logistic Regression
is a strong classical baseline for sentiment classification.


6. Engineering Design
---------------------

The codebase follows a modular structure:

    config.py      -> configuration management
    data.py        -> data loading and preprocessing
    model.py       -> model and feature construction
    train.py       -> pipeline orchestration
    evaluate.py    -> evaluation and output generation

All outputs (metrics, plots, top words) are saved
automatically inside the outputs/ directory.

This structure mirrors production-ready ML workflows
rather than single-script experiments.


7. Key Strengths
----------------

    - Clean and modular architecture
    - Reproducible results
    - Automatic output generation
    - Model interpretability
    - Balanced evaluation metrics
    - Clear separation of concerns


8. Conclusion
-------------

This project demonstrates a disciplined and structured
approach to sentiment analysis using classical machine
learning techniques.

It highlights not only classification performance,
but also transparency and understanding of model behavior.

The IMDB Sentiment Analysis project completes a
multi-modal machine learning portfolio alongside:

    - MNIST (image classification)
    - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (tabular classification)

Together, these projects demonstrate the ability to
design and implement machine learning solutions
across different data modalities.
