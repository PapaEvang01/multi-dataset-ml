IMDB Sentiment Analysis
Outputs Description
===========================


1. Overview
-----------

This document describes the outputs generated by the evaluation
phase of the IMDB Sentiment Analysis project.

All output files are automatically created inside the:

    outputs/

directory after running:

    python src/train.py


2. Metrics File
---------------

File:
    outputs/metrics.txt

Purpose:
    Contains the numerical evaluation results of the trained model.

Content Summary:

    - Overall Accuracy
    - Confusion Matrix
    - Precision, Recall, and F1-score per class
    - Macro and Weighted averages

For the current baseline model:

    Accuracy: 0.8978 (~89.8%)

Confusion Matrix:

    [[4432  568]
     [ 454 4546]]

Interpretation:

    - 4432 negative reviews correctly classified
    - 4546 positive reviews correctly classified
    - 568 false negatives
    - 454 false positives

The model shows balanced performance across both classes.


3. Confusion Matrix Visualization
----------------------------------

File:
    outputs/confusion_matrix.png

Purpose:
    Visual representation of prediction performance.

Description:

    - Diagonal cells represent correct classifications.
    - Off-diagonal cells represent misclassifications.
    - Color intensity reflects frequency.

This visualization provides a quick diagnostic overview
of classification behavior.


4. Top Words Analysis
---------------------

File:
    outputs/top_words.txt

Purpose:
    Provides model interpretability by extracting the most
    influential words based on Logistic Regression coefficients.

Content:

    - Top 25 words pushing predictions toward "pos"
    - Top 25 words pushing predictions toward "neg"
    - Coefficient magnitude for each word

Examples:

    Positive Indicators:
        great
        excellent
        amazing
        wonderful
        brilliant

    Negative Indicators:
        worst
        bad
        awful
        boring
        terrible

Interpretation:

    - Larger absolute coefficient values indicate stronger influence.
    - Positive coefficients push predictions toward positive sentiment.
    - Negative coefficients push predictions toward negative sentiment.

This analysis improves transparency and demonstrates
model reasoning rather than only reporting accuracy.


5. Reproducibility
------------------

All output files are generated automatically during evaluation.

To regenerate results:

    python src/train.py

No manual steps are required.


6. Conclusion
-------------

The outputs demonstrate:

    - Strong classification performance (~90% accuracy)
    - Balanced precision and recall
    - Clear error distribution
    - Interpretable feature influence

These outputs confirm that the model is both
accurate and interpretable, providing a complete
and professionally structured evaluation.
