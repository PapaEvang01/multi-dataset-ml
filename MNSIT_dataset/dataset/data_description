MNIST DATASET & REAL-WORLD EXTENSIONS
====================================

This project is based on the MNIST dataset and two custom real-world digit datasets
created to study the domain gap between benchmark data and real-world inputs.


1. MNIST DATASET
----------------

The MNIST dataset  is a widely used benchmark 
dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

It consists of:
- 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9)
- Image resolution: 28 × 28 pixels
- Pixel values normalized from [0, 255]
- 10 classes corresponding to digits 0–9

The dataset is split into:
- Training set: 60,000 images
- Test set: 10,000 images

MNIST images are centered, size-normalized, and captured under controlled
conditions. Because of this, models trained on MNIST typically achieve very high
accuracy but may struggle when applied to real-world images.


2. REAL-WORLD DATASET CREATION
------------------------------

To evaluate how well an MNIST-trained model generalizes to real-world inputs,
two small custom datasets were created:

Folder structure:
- dataset/
  ├── paint/
  └── handwritten/


2.1 PAINT DATASET
-----------------

The "paint" dataset was created using a digital drawing tool (e.g., MS Paint).

Creation process:
- Digits 0–9 were manually drawn using a mouse
- One image per digit
- White background with black digit strokes
- Saved as PNG images
- Filenames contain the digit label (e.g., 3_mnsit.png)

This dataset simulates:
- Clean but non-MNIST-like digit styles
- Digit shapes without camera noise
- Differences in stroke thickness and drawing style

Purpose:
- Evaluate model robustness to synthetic, non-handwritten digits
- Serve as an intermediate step between MNIST and real photos


2.2 HANDWRITTEN DATASET
----------------------

The "handwritten" dataset was created using real photographs of handwritten digits.

Creation process:
- Digits 0–9 written by hand on paper
- Photos taken using a mobile phone camera
- Images include real-world challenges such as:
  - Uneven lighting
  - Shadows
  - Background textures
  - Perspective distortions
- Saved as PNG images
- Filenames contain the digit label (e.g., hand_4.png)

This dataset represents:
- True real-world conditions
- Strong domain shift from MNIST
- Noisy, unconstrained input data

Purpose:
- Evaluate real-world generalization
- Test preprocessing robustness
- Analyze model failures under realistic conditions


3. MOTIVATION
-------------

While MNIST is useful for benchmarking, real-world digit recognition systems must
handle variations not present in the dataset.

By combining:
- MNIST (clean, standardized)
- Paint digits (synthetic but controlled)
- Handwritten photos (real-world, noisy)

this project demonstrates:
- The limitations of benchmark-only evaluation
- The impact of domain shift
- The need for preprocessing and fine-tuning strategies
- A realistic ML experimentation workflow


4. NOTES
--------

- The real-world datasets are intentionally small to reflect data-scarce scenarios
- Labels are inferred from filenames
- Images are preprocessed to match MNIST format (28×28, centered, normalized)
- Results show that high MNIST accuracy does not guarantee real-world performance

This dataset structure supports experimentation with preprocessing, transfer
learning, and mixed fine-tuning strategies.
