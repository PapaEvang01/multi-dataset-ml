🧠 From MNIST to the Real World
Evaluating and Adapting Digit Recognition Models Beyond the Dataset
📌 Project Overview

This project explores the gap between benchmark datasets and real-world data using handwritten digit recognition as a case study.

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is first trained on the classic MNIST dataset and then evaluated on real-world digit images collected manually (paint-drawn and handwritten).
The project demonstrates that high benchmark accuracy does not guarantee real-world robustness, and systematically investigates how preprocessing and fine-tuning can improve performance.

🎯 Objectives

Train a strong MNIST baseline CNN

Evaluate the model on real-world digit images

Design a robust OpenCV preprocessing pipeline

Quantify performance before and after adaptation

Apply fine-tuning and mixed training

Analyze failure cases and limitations

📂 Datasets
1️⃣ MNIST (Benchmark)

60,000 training images

10,000 test images

Grayscale, 28×28 pixels

Digits 0–9

2️⃣ Real-World Digits (Custom Dataset)

Collected manually and stored in Google Drive:

Paint digits (mouse-drawn, clean background)

Handwritten digits (pen/paper, photographed)

📌 Total images: ~20
📌 Purpose: simulate out-of-distribution (OOD) data

🧩 Methodology

The project is structured into three clear phases.

🔹 Phase 1 — MNIST Baseline Training
Model

A simple but effective CNN:

2 convolutional blocks (Conv → ReLU → MaxPool)

Fully connected classifier

Dropout for regularization

Training

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: CrossEntropy

Epochs: 10

Normalization using MNIST mean/std

Result

MNIST test accuracy ≈ 99%

Clean convergence, no overfitting

📌 This confirms the model learns the MNIST distribution well.

🔹 Phase 2 — Real-World Evaluation & Preprocessing
Problem Identified

When applying the MNIST-trained model directly to real images:

Strong performance degradation

High confidence wrong predictions

Especially poor results on handwritten photos

Solution: OpenCV Preprocessing Pipeline

A custom pipeline was designed to convert real images into MNIST-like inputs:

Grayscale conversion

CLAHE contrast normalization

Adaptive / Otsu thresholding

Morphological operations

Contour filtering (reject paper edges & noise)

Centering via center-of-mass

Final 28×28 normalization

Each image is:

Visualized (original vs processed)

Safely processed with failure handling

Logged and exported

🔹 Phase 3 — Fine-Tuning & Mixed Training
A) Real-World Fine-Tuning

CNN classifier head unfrozen

Convolutional layers frozen

Heavy augmentation on 28×28 digits

Very low learning rate

B) Mixed Fine-Tuning (MNIST + Real-World)

Alternating batches:

MNIST subset

Real-world digits

All layers unfrozen

Extremely low learning rate

Prevents catastrophic forgetting

📊 Results & Analysis
Real-World Accuracy (Summary)
Stage	Overall	Paint	Handwritten
Before adaptation	~0.42	~0.60	~0.22
After fine-tuning	~0.47	~0.60	~0.33
Mixed fine-tuning	~0.47	~0.60	~0.33

📈 A bar chart comparing paint vs handwritten across stages is included in the project.

🔍 Key Observations

Paint digits are relatively easy and already close to MNIST

Handwritten photos are the true challenge

Preprocessing is more important than model complexity

Fine-tuning improves robustness but is limited by data scarcity

The model often makes confident mistakes on OOD inputs

📌 This mirrors real industrial ML behavior.

⚠️ Limitations

Extremely small real-world dataset (~20 images)

No domain-specific data augmentation beyond geometry/noise

CNN architecture intentionally simple

No test-time augmentation or ensemble methods

🚀 Future Improvements

Collect larger handwritten dataset (100+ samples)

Add perspective correction & illumination modeling

Use domain adaptation techniques

Compare CNN vs Transformer-based models

Deploy as a real-time digit scanner

🧠 Why This Project Matters

This project is not about achieving high MNIST accuracy.

It demonstrates:

ML evaluation discipline

Understanding of distribution shift

Practical computer vision preprocessing

Careful experimentation & analysis

Real-world engineering mindset

📌 Exactly the kind of thinking required in applied AI roles.
