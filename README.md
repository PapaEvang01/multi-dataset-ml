# multi-dataset-ml
A reproducible Python machine learning project that benchmarks consistent pipelines across image, tabular, regression, and text datasets, with emphasis on evaluation, reproducibility, and clean engineering practices.

Multi-Dataset ML Lab is a personal machine learning portfolio project focused on building a reusable and reproducible experimentation framework in Python.
The project applies consistent workflows—data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and reporting—across diverse dataset types, including image classification (MNIST), tabular medical data (Breast Cancer Wisconsin), regression problems (California Housing), and text sentiment analysis (IMDB).

Rather than treating each dataset as an isolated notebook, this project emphasizes:

clean modular code,

fair model comparison,

domain-appropriate evaluation metrics,

reproducible experiments with saved artifacts.

The goal is to mirror real-world machine learning workflows where robustness, clarity, and evaluation discipline matter as much as model performance.
